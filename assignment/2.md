# Part 2: Widgets

During our trip, one of our developers figured it'd be nice to implement our own Component rendering library; PureWidget!

You can view the source and documentation in `widget/PureWidget.ts`. It's inspired a bit by React and its `PureComponents`.

_Actually, we didn't get super far as it doesn't use a Virtual DOM, JSX, reconciler and doesn't support unmounting / mounting new components dynamically. But hey, it's a start!_

## Problem

When you click to push a rider forward, we're seeing a lot of unnecessary renders of unrelated Widgets (see console log). Can you fix the bug?

Push your fix, create a PR (use Part 1 as base branch) and explain how you found it + why it fixes the bug.

(the bug is not in the framework itself, so don't modify `PureWidget.ts`)

# Part 1: Server-side

Instead of the single test player, we'd like to load the players in the game from our API.

1. Create the function `createPlayerWithKit` with `server/players.ts`
1. Switch the client to use `getPlayersFromServer` instead of `getSamplePlayers`
1. Can you make the app load faster (100s of milliseconds), without modifying the backend node.js code?

You can commit (and push) in-between. Create a PR before heading to assignment 2!
